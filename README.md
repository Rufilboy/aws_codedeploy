  What I've Learnt So Far
</h1>

## AWS Console
I'm able to navigate through AWS management console and make use of some AWS services like: IAM (user, role & policies), s3 bucket(for storage & hosting a static website) codecommit, codebuild, codepipeline, codedeploy, CloudFront (what content delivery network(CDN) is).

## Github Action 
So far I've understand what a github action does, in setting up a CI/CD pipeline.

## Conclusion
I'm able to setup a CI/CD on AWS using github, codebuild & codepipeline etc..
<!-- 
I don't think there's a problem one can encounter in his/her project, that someone else has never faced, thereby leaving the solution in different kind of format be it video, documentation or code etc.. 

The issue is just that how to find the right answer to solve your problem, sometimes critical because, you could've browse through all different communities of developers like stackoverflow, and you still don't get what you're looking for, but when you get what you are looking for, it works like magic. -->
